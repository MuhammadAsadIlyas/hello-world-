# hello-world-
just another repository
Hey GUYS! So I'm complete noob in programming but I am very willing to learn
I'm a photographer and also a beatboxer XD
I've always had a extreme interest for technology.
For starters I've been trying out android and how to unlock its full potential. It's basically flashing roms, custom recoveries, overclocking the CPU and more.
So that's just a part of my intro I guess. Github told me write about myself and so I did!
